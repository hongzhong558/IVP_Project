# IVP_Project

This repository is for the IVP course project. The codes cover basic image stitching and panoramic image stitching that applyies cylindrical projection and spherical projection. We tested the algorithm on photos taken by ourselves using iPhone 12 Pro. The results are good and can be found in the folder.
